# contreras.io
Code Repo for my personal website (contreras.io)\
The goal is to operate and maintain the website using what I have learned the past few years.

## Architecture 
Website is really simple; it's a static website saved in S3 with CloudFront used as the front end. 

## to-do
- Build website infrastructure via code and to build it via GitHub action
- Scan Iac with BridgeCrew and trigger scans via GH action
- Scan website with SAST and DAST toold and integrate it with GH action
- Add logging, WAF, and honeypot
